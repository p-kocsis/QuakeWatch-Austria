<p>AngularJS provides animation hooks for common directives such as <code>ngRepeat</code>, <code>ngSwitch</code>, and <code>ngView</code>, as well as custom directives
via the <code>$animate</code> service. These animation hooks are set in place to trigger animations during the life cycle of various directives and when
triggered, will attempt to perform a CSS Transition, CSS Keyframe Animation or a JavaScript callback Animation (depending on if an animation is
placed on the given directive). Animations can be placed using vanilla CSS by following the naming conventions set in place by AngularJS
or with JavaScript code when it&#39;s defined as a factory.</p>
